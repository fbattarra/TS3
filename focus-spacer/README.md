TS3 laser head has a 40mm focus (as far as I have found on internet, measured from the bottom of the laser head chassis) and comes with an aluminum spacer.

When you engrave or etch materials, the material's surface has to be 40mm far from the laser head for maximum precision. 
When you cut, you'd better focus the laser in the middle of the material's thickness: for 4mm plywood you'd focus the laser at 38mm from the plywood upper surface, and so on.

Should you need another one, here you have what I made. Just be advised that every material has its best speed/power settings, so what I used to cut & engrave could not be optimized for your :)
